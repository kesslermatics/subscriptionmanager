# Subscription Manager

This is a simple app to visualize all of your current subscriptions. 

### Frontpage

On the frontpage you see all of of your added subscriptions.
You also see the total cost of your active subscriptions per month.

### Add a subscription

Simply click on the floatingbutton at the bottom-center.
From there on you can type in your title and the monthly cost. 
By clicking on "Speichern" you add this subscription to your frontpage

### Managing your subscriptions

By switching the switch on each subscription you activate your subscription and the total cost will update too.
So you only have to add one and can easily deactivate it.

You can delete a subscription by simply pressing and holding it.

### Future

There is in my opinion no necessary extra feature to implement.
